"To this man will I look"  Isa 66:2
GOD IS EVER LOOKING, SEEKING FAITHFUL MEN FOR
HIS KINGDOM.  The Lord will look to the poor in spirit,
the humble,  the man who trembles at His word, who lies
low in self-abasement at His throne, who mourns over
his follies and his faults.  He will look to the one who fears
to offend a God so good, so holy, so great,  the man who
looks to Jesus for life, peace, and everlasting salvation.
To such the Lord will look.  He will observe them, welcome
them, and manifest His approval of them.  He will look
and love,  look and listen to their prayers,  look and accept
their persons and services,  look and honour them.   He
will visit them as His friends, dwell with them as His
children, own them as His jewels, and use them as
instruments for His glory.  He will look upon them and
strengthen them as He did Gideon;  look, and restore them
as He did Peter;  look, and so lift up the light of His
countenance upon them, and give them peace.  My soul,
hast thou been looking to the Lord today?  Hast thou
looked unto Him as thy Father?  If so, doubtless He has
been looking upon thee with a Father's love.  He is now
looking upon thee with approval.  Sweet thought!  The
look of God our Father is more than wealth, more than
honour.  Retire to rest this night with the thought, Jehovah
is looking upon me with love.
He proves His love, displays His grace,
Through the redemption of His Son;
He turns my feet from sinful ways,
And pardons wrongs my hands have done.
