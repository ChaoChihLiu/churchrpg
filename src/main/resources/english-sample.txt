<div><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>GOD’S WORD FOR STRANGERS</strong></span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The word “<em>stranger</em>” describes a sojourner. He counts the place he is&nbsp;staying in as a transient abode for he is aware that he is just a pilgrim.&nbsp;He is a stranger on earth. He may be a citizen of a certain country, but he&nbsp;knows well he is not to live on this planet that long. Sooner or later, as a&nbsp;stranger, he is ready to move on to a place farther from here. He counts&nbsp;not this earth as his final dwelling place, but that he is an alien on this ball&nbsp;of dust and looks forward to being found in that eternal abode prepared&nbsp;for God’s children. He is a Christian, a citizen of heaven!</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hide it not</span>: He cries for the Word not to be concealed from him. He&nbsp;believes he cannot survive living as a stranger on this earth without the&nbsp;Word. What he needs is for the Word to be kept close to him, he cannot&nbsp;afford to be far from the shield and refuge of his soul. The oppression&nbsp;from the people on this earth is hard and cruel; he requires the Word to&nbsp;assure him that this will not last for long. He will soon be transported to&nbsp;another realm, a place where there are no more tears in his eyes. Read&nbsp;Revelation 21:4. The Word is not to be covered. He wants it opened before&nbsp;his eyes.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Longing for it</span>: His soul longs for the Word. The stranger has no other&nbsp;source of sustenance to strengthen him, the Word is the daily bread for&nbsp;his soul. His longing consumes his spirit as he seeks after the manna&nbsp;for his hungry soul. He knows the Word to be his milk and meat that&nbsp;provides his daily energy as he lives his life that is full of adversity. In&nbsp;the face of the dangers of the enemies lurking in secret places to attack&nbsp;him, the poisonous asps and scorpions awaiting anyone who passes by,&nbsp;the fearsome tempests and violent winds that blow against his ways, only&nbsp;the Word can assure him that there is a Promised Land filled with milk&nbsp;and honey awaiting him. He pursues after the Word to remind him that&nbsp;he is a stranger whose destination is the land of Beulah!</span></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Dear reader, do you consider yourself a stranger on this earth? If so then&nbsp;you have no other need but the Word of God.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>THOUGHT:</strong> Am I a stranger on this earth?</span></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>PRAYER:</strong> Father, may I keep the Promised Land in sight.</span></p>
