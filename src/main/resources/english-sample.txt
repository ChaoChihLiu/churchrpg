<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">What a sweet title: “My people!” What a cheering revelation: “Their God!”&nbsp;How much of meaning is couched in those two words, “My people!” Here&nbsp;is speciality. The whole world is God’s; the heaven, even the heaven of&nbsp;heavens is the Lord’s, and he reigneth among the children of men; but of&nbsp;those whom he hath chosen, whom he hath purchased to himself, he saith&nbsp;what he saith not of others – “My people.” In this word there is the idea&nbsp;of proprietorship. In a special manner the “Lord’s portion is his people;&nbsp;Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.” All the nations upon earth are his; the&nbsp;whole world is in his power; yet are his people, his chosen, more especially&nbsp;his possession; for he has done more for them than others; he has bought&nbsp;them with his blood; he has brought them nigh to himself; he has set his&nbsp;great heart upon them; he has loved them with an everlasting love, a love&nbsp;which many waters cannot quench, and which the revolutions of time&nbsp;shall never suffice in the least degree to diminish. Dear friends, can you,&nbsp;by faith, see yourselves in that number? Can you look up to heaven and&nbsp;say, “My Lord and my God: mine by that sweet relationship which entitles&nbsp;me to call thee Father; mine by that hallowed fellowship which I delight&nbsp;to hold with thee when thou art pleased to manifest thyself unto me as&nbsp;thou dost not unto the world?” Canst thou read the Book of Inspiration,&nbsp;and find there the indentures of thy salvation? Canst thou read thy title&nbsp;writ in precious blood? Canst thou, by humble faith, lay hold of Jesus’&nbsp;garments, and say, “My Christ”? If thou canst, then God saith of thee, and&nbsp;of others like thee, “My people;” for, if God be your God, and Christ your&nbsp;Christ, the Lord has a special, peculiar favour to you; you are the object of&nbsp;his choice, accepted in his beloved Son.</span></div>
