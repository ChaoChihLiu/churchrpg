<div><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Leviticus 1</strong></span></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Hebrews 10:1</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>“Speak unto the children of Israel,</em></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>and say unto them, If any man of you</em></span></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>bring an offering unto the LORD…”</em></span></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">THE PURPOSE OF LEVITICAL LAWS</span></strong></p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The LORD gave to His people three types of laws. They were: the Moral&nbsp;Laws which are summarised in the Ten Commandments; the Civil Laws&nbsp;to regulate the conduct of the people of Israel inside the Land of Promise;&nbsp;and the Levitical Laws. Incorporated into the Civil Laws were the&nbsp;restitutions and punishments for both victims and culprits respectively.&nbsp;For example, if someone stole a sheep, killed it and was caught, he had to&nbsp;pay four sheep to the victim. If it was an ox, he had to pay five oxen. It is&nbsp;not the same for the Moral Laws.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Moral Laws were given by God to show sinners that they are great&nbsp;sinners against God. For example, sinners did not know that it was a&nbsp;sin to covet. God has given to man the 10th Commandment, “<em>Thou shalt&nbsp;not covet</em>…” (Exod 20:17). Now whenever man covets, his conscience is&nbsp;pricked. He might not have actually sinned against the person whose&nbsp;thing he coveted, but he has already sinned against God. Through the Ten&nbsp;Commandments, sinners will now know that when they steal it is also a&nbsp;sin against God and not just against man. This applies to dishonouring&nbsp;father or mother, adultery, killing, and bearing a false witness. The Moral&nbsp;Laws were given to drive sinners to seek the Saviour because they are&nbsp;very much aware of their great sins before God. But there is no restitution&nbsp;or way to repent and reconcile their relationship with God given within&nbsp;the Moral Laws, unlike the Civil Laws. That is where the Levitical Laws&nbsp;come in.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Levitical Laws were given by God to help His people mend&nbsp;their broken relationship and fellowship with Him. The Moral Laws&nbsp;condemned but the Levitical Laws restored and taught the people of God&nbsp;what they must do when they could not approach God, e.g. what was&nbsp;unclean and how to be clean again so that they could live in holiness. In&nbsp;the Book of Leviticus is found the system of sacrifices that sinners must&nbsp;offer to have their sins forgiven. All the offerings mentioned in Leviticus&nbsp;are types of Christ.</span></div>
