<div><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>THE CONFIDENCE OF FAITH</strong></span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The boldness and confidence with which Boaz spoke is amazing,&nbsp;considering the uncertainty of life and the frailty of man. We make plans&nbsp;and dream dreams, only to either change them as we make adjustments&nbsp;in life due to unforeseen and unavoidable circumstances, or drop&nbsp;them altogether and go back to the drawing board to make new plans&nbsp;due to human failure or weaknesses that render our plans and dreams&nbsp;impractical or impossible to achieve.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">“…<em>ye are witnesses this day</em>” (Ruth 4:10)</span>. When we consider God’s design,&nbsp;Word and principles in regard to marriage and relationships, and the&nbsp;individual’s roles and duties in them, we realise that none of the roles&nbsp;and duties are exclusive or complete by themselves, and marriage cannot&nbsp;be established by the efforts and commitment of one spouse alone. The&nbsp;teachings on the roles of the members of the family in Scripture, be they of&nbsp;husbands, wives, parents, or children, show that they are complementary&nbsp;roles. None is complete without the other, and each works better and more&nbsp;easily and bears more fruit as the other works too. It is easier for the wife&nbsp;to submit when the husband is loving and vice versa. Thus, as Boaz spoke&nbsp;of what his role was as a kinsman-redeemer and said, “…<em>have I purchased&nbsp;to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that&nbsp;the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the&nbsp;gate of his place</em>…” (Ruth 4:10), one may be tempted to ask: “How do you&nbsp;know for sure that you will accomplish what you are setting out to do? Is&nbsp;it all up to you?” However, Boaz was speaking by faith. His role was to do&nbsp;God’s will and fulfil his God-given responsibility, and God would fulfil&nbsp;His Word and accomplish His plan. Boaz believed God would accomplish&nbsp;His Word, and therefore his part was to focus on obeying God and doing&nbsp;what God had instructed in His Word. As he said to Ruth at the threshing&nbsp;floor, “…<em>if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee, then will I do</em>…”&nbsp;(Ruth 3:13), that was submission to God’s will. In Ruth 4:10, Boaz’s focus&nbsp;was on what God had laid out in His Word for the kinsman to do, and&nbsp;that was commitment and faith. He was given the rights to redeem, so it&nbsp;was God’s will for him to do so.</span></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>THOUGHT:</strong> Confidence of faith is acted out in responsible obedience.</span></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>PRAYER:</strong> Father, give me grace to discern and obey Thy will.</span></p>
