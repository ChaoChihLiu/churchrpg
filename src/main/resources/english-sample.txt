<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Families in general face unprecedented strain and stress. The rates&nbsp;of divorce and separation are on the rise, and the number of those&nbsp;disillusioned by marriage is increasing. Even among Christians, there&nbsp;is a great challenge around the issue of marriage. Ruth chapter 3 takes&nbsp;place at the end of the harvest period, and gives us a good pattern for&nbsp;choices regarding family life. The pattern is one that involves the leading&nbsp;of providence coupled with the guidance of godly wisdom from parents.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">“…My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?”&nbsp;(Ruth 3:1)</span>. The previous chapter highlights the workings of the hand of&nbsp;providence. This chapter now turns to the guidance, godly wisdom and&nbsp;action required to establish one’s life especially in marriage matters.&nbsp;Although marriage is the union between one man and one woman&nbsp;according to God’s holy ordinance, and involves forsaking father and&nbsp;mother in order to cleave to one another, the process by which the two&nbsp;enter into this union is not to be secretive and limited to the two of them.&nbsp;In the case of Ruth, Naomi took the initiative on behalf of Ruth.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The initiative that Naomi took was to “<em>seek rest</em>” on behalf of Ruth. This&nbsp;gives us her perspective for family life. This was her desire even as she&nbsp;bade her two daughters-in-law leave and return to their homes. Ruth 1:9:&nbsp;“<em>The LORD grant ye that you may find rest, each of you in the house of her&nbsp;husband</em>.” The initiative Naomi was taking was that which she probably&nbsp;believed their mothers would have taken on their behalf as she had&nbsp;bidden them, “<em>Go, return each to her mother’s house</em>” (Ruth 1:8). As their&nbsp;mother-in-law, she had considered it her duty to provide husbands for&nbsp;them, hence she had asked them, “<em>why will ye go with me? are there yet any&nbsp;more sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?</em>” (Ruth 1:11). The&nbsp;husband’s home is God’s provision for the protection, safety, welfare and&nbsp;honour for the wife, and it is there that the wife finds a place to practise&nbsp;piety and give no occasion to the adversary (Titus 2:4-5; 1 Tim 5:14, Eph 6:13-17;7:18, Eph 6:13-17; 7:14-20, Eph 6:13,7:19-20).</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>THOUGHT:</strong> Marriage is an honourable and godly estate.</span></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>PRAYER:</strong> Father, grant us godly homes that offer refuge for the family.</span></p>
