<p>"THE LORD IS AT HAND." He has promised, "I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world." In Him we rejoice alway. Without Him, this is a very difficult precept; sometimes the Lord hides His face; we fear and doubt our interest in His love; we are almost bewildered through the powerful workings of corruption within us; we are bowed down by Satan's sore temptations; and the dispensations of providence are so perplexing that we are ready to cry out, "All things are against us." But we are not bidden to rejoice in persons and feelings, or in the dispensations of providence, but in the Lord. He has loved us with an everlasting love, and His love is immutably the same; He is our God in Jesus, and has promised to be unto us, to do for us, and freely give us, all that our circumstances require, or that will be for our good and His glory. In weakness we may rejoice in His power; in darkness we may rejoice that He knows our path; in sickness and sorrow, that He cares for us; and under any circumstances, in His covenant relations; for He is always our Father, Friend, and God. We should rejoice in His free grace, rich mercy, omnipotent power, faithful promises, special providence, and unchangeable love.</p>
<p><strong>For <strong>Meditation</strong>:</strong><br /> Rejoice in glorious hope!<br /> Jesus, the Judge, shall come,<br /> And take His servants up<br /> To their eternal home;<br /> We soon shall hear the archangel's voice-<br /> The trump of God shall sound, "Rejoice!"</p>
