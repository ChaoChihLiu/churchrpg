<div><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>JOSHUA SPOKE OF THE SUM OF HIS SERVICE</strong></span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Isa 15:2-3, It was now time to recount the sum of what God had done through&nbsp;Joshua. Joshua told Israel to fear God and serve Him sincerely by putting&nbsp;away the false gods and serving God only. He spoke of all those wonders&nbsp;to remind Israel lest they forget. He conveyed this message from God as&nbsp;his final communication to the nation. It was a great blessing to be used&nbsp;of God in the prime of his life. Joshua desired lasting results. This was in&nbsp;his heart when he convened that assembly.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Joshua, being an old man, spoke and addressed a new generation. He had&nbsp;enough experience of human weakness in following God and he knew&nbsp;how easy it was for the nation to leave God to serve other gods. Thus, he&nbsp;summoned all his energy to bring the message home to that assembly.&nbsp;Joshua was not formally a prophet, but he did the work of a prophet&nbsp;because he conveyed the message of God to Israel.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Joshua urged the nation to serve God with sincerity, not with lip service.&nbsp;The people, who came out of Egypt and had experienced crossing the Red&nbsp;Sea on its dried sea bed, would react differently from those who simply&nbsp;heard about it. They were hesitant, but they saw the salvation of God.&nbsp;Joshua had witnessed all those wonders of the Exodus, thus when he&nbsp;spoke of sincerity, he himself was sincere. He stated his own commitment&nbsp;to serve God. When he said this, the whole assembly of Israel was of one&nbsp;accord. They pledged before Joshua that they would not forsake God or&nbsp;serve other gods. They pledged to serve God only. The main reason it&nbsp;was abominable to serve other gods was that it would be a denial of God&nbsp;who had brought them out of Egypt. It was also prohibited in the first&nbsp;commandment. It was thus part of their confession to believe in the true&nbsp;God, commonly referred to as the God of Israel. They acknowledged that&nbsp;it was God who had brought them out with a mighty hand and had done&nbsp;wonders all the way until they were settled in Canaan.</span></div>
