<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">It is most comforting to know that in the midst of the period of Judges&nbsp;(lasted more than 350 years) when every man did what was right in his&nbsp;own eyes that there was a woman of prayer, faith and devotion in Israel.&nbsp;Her name was Hannah. The LORD had “<em>shut up her womb</em>” (1 Sam 1:5)&nbsp;which was considered a curse according to the Law of Moses. Added on&nbsp;to this stigma was the torment she received from Peninnah, her husband’s&nbsp;other wife. No matter how much more her husband loved her compared&nbsp;to Peninnah it brought little or no comfort. The curse of a barren womb&nbsp;and provocation from Peninnah were beyond earthly comfort.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">During one of these annual trips to Shiloh where the Tabernacle was&nbsp;located, Hannah prayed to the LORD for mercy. She vowed that if the&nbsp;LORD granted her a son, she would dedicate him to the LORD as a&nbsp;Nazarite to serve Him all his life. The Lord heard her cry and granted her&nbsp;desire. She named her son Samuel (i.e. asked of God) because she asked&nbsp;for a son from the LORD.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">From the darkest moment of her life, she experienced the brightest light&nbsp;from the Lord. She kept her word and dedicated Samuel to the LORD.&nbsp;Samuel became the last judge and the first prophet to rule Israel before&nbsp;the monarchy. He was also a king-maker.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Samuel was a faithful servant of the LORD.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>THOUGHT:</strong> Pray to the Lord in the darkest hour and experience the&nbsp;light.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>PRAYER:</strong> Father, may I pray always especially when all seem hopeless.&nbsp;For Jesus’ sake, hear my humble cry.</span></div>
