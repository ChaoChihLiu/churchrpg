<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><i>LORD’S DAY, JUNE 29 EVENING</i></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Leviticus 27</b></span></p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><i>“These are the commandments,</i></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><i>which the LORD commanded Moses</i></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><i>for the children of Israel in mount Sinai.”</i></span></p>

<p class="p6"><span class="s1">When the LORD made Israel into a nation, He ruled Israel Himself, i.e. by&nbsp;theocracy. God did not need armies to fight His battles. But He appointed&nbsp;the tribe of Levi to care for the spiritual well-being of Israel. The priesthood&nbsp;came from the tribe of Levi. Their duties included administering the&nbsp;sacrificial system of worship, as well as studying and teaching the Word&nbsp;of God fulltime. They lived in forty-eight Levitical cities chosen by God,&nbsp;located throughout the length and breadth of the Promised Land on both&nbsp;sides of the River Jordan. This ensured that every tribe in Israel would not&nbsp;need to travel long distances to be taught God’s Word.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">To care for the physical well-being of the Levites, the LORD declared that&nbsp;the firstfruits and the tithes of the twelve tribes given to the LORD would&nbsp;be received by the priests and Levites respectively for their food. In this&nbsp;way, the priests could care for the spiritual well-being of the twelve tribes&nbsp;and in return the twelve tribes would care for the physical well-being&nbsp;of the priests and Levites. These tithes and offerings and any freewill&nbsp;offerings that were already decided by the LORD to be devoted to Him&nbsp;and to support the priests and Levites, could not be redeemed. They had&nbsp;to be given accordingly. If a relative desired to help out another who could&nbsp;not pay his tithe, then a levy of a fifth part of the tithe would be added on.&nbsp;In the case of clean animals, a tenth would have to be added. They would&nbsp;all be holy unto the LORD. Anyone who tried to redeem that which had&nbsp;been declared to be devoted unto the LORD, would be put to death. This&nbsp;was a serious transgression against the LORD. Christians today must&nbsp;learn from this teaching. Tithes and offerings that are commanded by the&nbsp;LORD must be given to the LORD willingly and cheerfully. We cannot&nbsp;reason that since I am not cheerful and willing, therefore I ought not&nbsp;to give. The teaching teaches us to give cheerfully. It is not to be used&nbsp;as an excuse not to give of that which has been declared devoted unto&nbsp;the LORD.</span></p>

<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><b>PRAYER:</b> Father, may I give of my tithes cheerfully unto Thee as an&nbsp;expression of giving myself totally to Thee, for Jesus’ sake. Amen.</span></p>
