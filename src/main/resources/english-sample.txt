<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Who is the authority of your life? Many people submit to their bosses&nbsp;because they decide their tenure in the company. They are scared to offend&nbsp;them, so they become “yes-men” to keep their rice bowl (their job). The&nbsp;words of these managers and CEOs are the compasses directing everything&nbsp;people in the lower echelon do. Not one word of these higher officials&nbsp;must be disobeyed. They become little gods to the ordinary people.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">My ruler</span>: When the psalmist is confronted with the words of the princes&nbsp;who are against him, he is confident. Not because he has the power to&nbsp;oppose them, but because he meditates on the Word of God. He ponders&nbsp;and communes with the Word and the Author of it. His trust is in the Giver&nbsp;of the Word whose wisdom is beyond measure. Read Romans 11:33-34.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">My counsellor</span>: To the psalmist, his counsellor is the Word of God. He&nbsp;takes advice and counsel from it. He does not seek the wisdom of the&nbsp;world. The words of the most renowned come only from his puny little&nbsp;brain. But the counsel from God’s Word is from the Omniscient God who&nbsp;knows and understands everything from the beginning to the end. Read&nbsp;Isaiah 55:8-9. He trusts in the wisdom of God as the best. There is nothing&nbsp;that can prevent his heart from relying on the Word of the Almighty.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Dear reader, who is your authority and guide? Do you entrust your future&nbsp;to men who do not even know their own future? Do you seek to follow&nbsp;the people who do not even know where they are going? Do you listen to&nbsp;the counsel of people who do not understand even their own feelings and&nbsp;emotions? Lean not on the flesh but cling to the wonder-working power&nbsp;of the Word that transforms a spiritually dead person into one who lives&nbsp;not just temporarily but eternally.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Find comfort in the Word of God which is the truth. Do not be like&nbsp;those men who may appear obedient to God’s Word but their deeds are&nbsp;not according to the truth. Let the Word be the sole, supreme and final&nbsp;authority of your faith and practice.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>THOUGHT:</strong> What is the authority over my life?</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>PRAYER:</strong> Father, may Thou be the final authority of my life, and let me&nbsp;not listen to the lame counsel of this world.</span></div>
