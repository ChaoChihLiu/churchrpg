<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The story of Micah presents to us that the failure of the domestic system&nbsp;is rooted in the failure of religious instruction and guidance. The people&nbsp;groped in darkness mainly because those who were supposed to shine the&nbsp;light of God’s Word had hidden it under a bushel. Micah, the man who&nbsp;stole from his mother, the one who only restored what he had stolen due&nbsp;to pressure from superstition, was the one who now had a “<em>house of gods</em>”&nbsp;and “<em>made an ephod, and teraphim</em>,” and consecrated “<em>one of his sons,&nbsp;who became his priest</em>.” The failure of religious instruction and guidance&nbsp;is presented to us in the introduction of the Levite who passed by and&nbsp;became a priest for hire.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">“…<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>I am a Levite of Bethlehemjudah, and I go to sojourn where I may find a&nbsp;place</em>” (Judg 17:9)</span>. The family’s religious arrangement sufficed the family&nbsp;of Micah until a visitor passed by. Upon interaction with the man, Micah&nbsp;realised he was a true Levite who appeared displaced. Why the Levite&nbsp;was displaced is not told to us, but here is presented to us a man who&nbsp;had been forced by circumstances to forsake his call and seek out a living&nbsp;for himself. Micah invited him to stay and minister to his family with a&nbsp;promise of provision for basic needs (food, clothing and housing) and&nbsp;some stipend.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">“…<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a priest…and the young&nbsp;man was unto him as one of his sons</em>” (Judg 17:10-11)</span>. The offer given by&nbsp;Micah and the reality that came to be did not correspond. The failure of&nbsp;the religious system is not only revealed in the idolatry of Micah’s family&nbsp;and the seeking out a living of the Levite, but also in the changed roles.&nbsp;Though he was asked by Micah to be “<em>unto me a father</em>,” he became “<em>as&nbsp;one of his sons</em>.” Micah’s superstitious heart was appeased and the Levite’s&nbsp;physical needs were fulfilled and both were content with it. None sought&nbsp;to know or do God’s will. All just sought to quieten the discontent within.&nbsp;That is what religion is turning into today: the silencing and dulling of&nbsp;the conscience through the scratching of itching ears and the satisfying&nbsp;of fleshly desires.</span></div>
