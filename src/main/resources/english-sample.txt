<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">If the young man in the gospel used this title in speaking to our Lord,&nbsp;how much more fitly may I thus address him! He is indeed my Master&nbsp;in both senses, a ruling Master and a teaching Master. I delight to run&nbsp;upon his errands, and to sit at his feet. I am both his servant and his&nbsp;disciple, and count it my highest honour to own the double character. If&nbsp;he should ask me why I call him “good,” I should have a ready answer. It&nbsp;is true that “there is none good but one, that is, God,” but then he is God,&nbsp;and all the goodness of Deity shines forth in him. In my experience, I&nbsp;have found him good, so good, indeed, that all the good I have has come&nbsp;to me through him. He was good to me when I was dead in sin, for he&nbsp;raised me by his Spirit’s power; he has been good to me in all my needs,&nbsp;trials, struggles, and sorrows. Never could there be a better Master, for&nbsp;his service is freedom, his rule is love: I wish I were one thousandth part&nbsp;as good a servant. When he teaches me as my Rabbi, he is unspeakably&nbsp;good, his doctrine is divine, his manner is condescending, his spirit is&nbsp;gentleness itself. No error mingles with his instruction – pure is the&nbsp;golden truth which he brings forth, and all his teachings lead to goodness,&nbsp;sanctifying as well as edifying the disciple. Angels find him a good Master&nbsp;and delight to pay their homage at his footstool. The ancient saints proved&nbsp;him to be a good Master, and each of them rejoiced to sing, “I am thy&nbsp;servant, O Lord!” My own humble testimony must certainly be to the&nbsp;same effect. I will bear this witness before my friends and neighbours, for&nbsp;possibly they may be led by my testimony to seek my Lord Jesus as their&nbsp;Master. O that they would do so! They would never repent so wise a deed.&nbsp;If they would but take his easy yoke, they would find themselves in so&nbsp;royal a service that they would enlist in it for ever.</span></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>THOUGHT:</strong> How am I serving my Good Master?</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>PRAYER:</strong> Father, grant me humility to truly serve Thee, for Thou art my&nbsp;Good Master.</span></div>
