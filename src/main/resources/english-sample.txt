<div><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Psalm 119:126-128</strong></span></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Habakkuk 1:1-4</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>“…judgment doth never go forth:</em></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>for the wicked doth</em></span></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>compass about the righteous…”</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>GOD’S WORD FOR THE LAWLESS</strong></span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The psalmist sees that many are making void God’s law. They break every&nbsp;commandment of God and do what is right in their own eyes. They violate&nbsp;his laws to pursue their immoral and sinful ways. They are full of iniquity&nbsp;for they disregard the precepts of God. They frustrate many because their&nbsp;actions are contrary to God’s purposes. They are lawless and they are to&nbsp;be judged under the very law that they ridicule.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Love God’s commandments</span>: The psalmist resolves that though many are&nbsp;lawless, he must not be. He instead should love the commandments of&nbsp;God. To love is to cherish with affection. You devote time to the reading&nbsp;of God’s law if indeed you love it. Not just reading, but understanding&nbsp;and doing it. The psalmist knows to love God’s commandment is not an&nbsp;ordinary love. It is love that is greater than how a man values gold, even&nbsp;fine gold. People are ready to sell everything they have to buy fine gold.&nbsp;But how about the Word, in which God’s commandments are found?</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Esteem all His precepts</span>: To esteem is to consider all of God’s law as wholly&nbsp;right and to value it highly. To regard God’s Word highly would also mean&nbsp;a man must hate false ways. He must reject the wrong and erroneous ways&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">to consider the law as right and truthful. The psalmist sees that the lawless&nbsp;invalidate the law and do not highly esteem God’s Word. But the psalmist&nbsp;lifts up the law as high as he can to magnify the Word of God, and glorify&nbsp;the God of the Word.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In these last days, false teachings and doctrines are plaguing the churches&nbsp;and seminaries, overwhelming many so that their love for the Word will&nbsp;wax cold. Therefore, the Word must be loved more than anything else in&nbsp;this world. The Word must be esteemed so highly by the believers that&nbsp;they will not be influenced by the false ways of the world.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Dear reader, keep yourself under God’s hand, and be found a worthy&nbsp;follower of Jesus. The lawful, righteous saint of God must love the&nbsp;commandments of God above all else. He must also highly esteem the&nbsp;Word. The Word must dominate the people.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>THOUGHT:</strong> Am I lawless?</span></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>PRAYER:</strong> Father, may I esteem Thy Word very highly.</span></p>
