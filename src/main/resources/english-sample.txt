<div><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Leviticus 9</strong></span></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">1 Timothy 2:5-6</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>“…and the glory of the LORD</em></span></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>appeared unto all the people.”</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>THE GLORY OF THE LORD APPEARED!</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The inaugural service went on very well. Aaron and his sons offered&nbsp;offerings for themselves before they offered the offerings of the people. The&nbsp;sequence of complete offerings on behalf of the people was sin offering,&nbsp;followed by burnt offering, peace offering and thank offering or wave&nbsp;offering. From verses 15 to 23, all was in order. Moses and Aaron went&nbsp;into the tabernacle of the congregation, i.e. the Holy Place, from the altar&nbsp;of burnt offering. Moses represented God whereas Aaron represented the&nbsp;priesthood and the people of God. It is not stated how long they remained&nbsp;inside. But Moses was probably explaining to Aaron what the duties of&nbsp;the priests were in relation to the lampstand, table of shewbread and the&nbsp;altar of incense.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">After their time inside the Holy Place, they came out and blessed the&nbsp;people of Israel. Leviticus 9:23 said that “<em>the glory of the LORD appeared&nbsp;unto all the people</em>.” It was a blessed time of great joy and thanksgiving&nbsp;since it was a blessed inaugural service. A fire came out from before the&nbsp;LORD and consumed upon the altar of burnt offering and the fat. The&nbsp;people saw what the LORD did and they shouted and fell on their faces.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The LORD was pleased with what His people did thus far. They understood&nbsp;and performed the spiritual duties according to Holy Scriptures led by&nbsp;Moses and Aaron. This spiritual act completed the instruction of the&nbsp;LORD in teaching His people how to be holy as He is holy. The Ten&nbsp;Commandments taught them God’s standard of holiness which convicted&nbsp;all men of sin against God. The Levitical priesthood taught them the way&nbsp;back to the LORD where without the shedding of blood, there was no&nbsp;remission of sin. The LORD was pleased and so were the people of God.&nbsp;Christians today need to remember their inaugural experience before the&nbsp;LORD by living a holy life. It was their day of salvation when the LORD&nbsp;washed away all their sins by the blood of Christ, His perfect Lamb.</span></div>
