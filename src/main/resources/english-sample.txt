<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Naomi’s advice to Ruth was one that showed great wisdom. The chapter&nbsp;which began with a call to action with instructions and counsel on what&nbsp;to do in the pursuit of “<em>rest</em>,” ended with a call to do probably the most&nbsp;difficult thing that could be asked of anyone: to be still. Yet, this call is a&nbsp;common call to God’s people. This is seen from the call of Moses to the&nbsp;children of Israel when standing before the Red Sea, “<em>Fear ye not, stand&nbsp;still, and see the salvation of the LORD</em>” (Exod 14:13), to Joshua’s call to the&nbsp;priests bearing the Ark who were to lead them across the Jordan, “<em>When&nbsp;ye are come to the brink of the water of Jordan, ye shall stand still in Jordan</em>”&nbsp;(Josh 3:8).</span></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">“<em>Then said she, Sit still, my daughter</em>…” (Ruth 3:18)</span>. The call to be still&nbsp;is not, in this case, an admission of helplessness or hopelessness, but&nbsp;rather it is the opposite. It is an expression of faith and confidence that&nbsp;although we had done our part and could do no more, things did not&nbsp;depend upon our action, but rather upon the work of One who works&nbsp;for His glory and our good. It comes from the understanding that there&nbsp;is one who works for us, as Naomi explained to Ruth as she called her to&nbsp;sit still. Naomi said, “<em>the man will not be in rest, until he have finished the&nbsp;thing this day</em>.” This was a testimony to the character and commitment&nbsp;of the kinsman-redeemer. There was nothing more that Ruth could do,&nbsp;but there was no need for her to do any more, as the case and matter&nbsp;had been taken up with one who would be their advocate, to plead their&nbsp;case before the elders of the city. All the actions and activity of Ruth were&nbsp;geared to getting the assistance and advocacy of Boaz, and as she had&nbsp;returned with the assurance from Boaz that he would “<em>do to thee all that&nbsp;thou requirest</em>,” she did not need to do any more and indeed could do no&nbsp;more. If Ruth had told Naomi everything that Boaz had said, this would&nbsp;mean that Naomi was confident that Boaz would address even the matter&nbsp;of the nearer kinsman, which she had not thought of as she directed Ruth&nbsp;on what to do. The matter with all its complications and intricacies would&nbsp;be addressed. And, indeed, Boaz did address it such that all their hopes&nbsp;were realised and God was glorified.</span></div>
