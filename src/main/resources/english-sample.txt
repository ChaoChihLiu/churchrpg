<div><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>YIELDING AND TRUSTING</strong></span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">With their reviving spiritual condition, they said one to another, “<em>What is&nbsp;this that God hath done unto us?</em>” (Gen 42:28). The happenings of the past&nbsp;few days had built up such great tension and anxiety that the brothers&nbsp;began to recognise that God’s hand was in the whole matter. To continue&nbsp;to run their own lives “in the flesh” would not do! God was dealing with&nbsp;them. They had to fully yield, otherwise they would not have peace.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Jacob refused to entertain the demand for Benjamin to be taken to Egypt:&nbsp;“You have bereaved me of two sons. Now you want to take Benjamin&nbsp;away. Everything is against me!” For Jacob, there was a lesson to be learnt&nbsp;also. Over the years, he had slackened in his zeal towards God. He had&nbsp;to come back to the place of full trust and obedience. Their physical&nbsp;need compelled them to submit to another lesson in God’s school of&nbsp;chastening. Even Jacob had to re-learn the same lesson. As their food&nbsp;stocks ran dry, he had to yield: “<em>Go again, buy us a little food</em>,” (Gen 43:2).&nbsp;But without Benjamin! At this impasse, Judah assumed leadership of the&nbsp;brothers. He set out the case for going down to Egypt with Benjamin:&nbsp;“Let Benjamin go with me. I will be surety for him. Let me personally be&nbsp;responsible for his safe return. We must go and get food that we may live&nbsp;and not die.” The argument was forcibly driven home to Jacob: “If you fear&nbsp;for Benjamin and keep him at home, then we will all starve to death. If we&nbsp;see the Egyptian without Benjamin, we will also die!”</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Then Jacob saw the light. “If it has to be, it has to be! But do things the&nbsp;right way: with dignity, courtesy, honesty! Take along the best gifts for the&nbsp;Governor, and also double the money to make good the payment for the&nbsp;previous supplies. Take also your brother.” Finally, Jacob demonstrated&nbsp;his implicit trust in God. “<em>And God Almighty give you mercy before the&nbsp;man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be&nbsp;bereaved… I am bereaved</em>” (Gen 43:14). Jacob had arrived at the place of&nbsp;total surrender to the hand of God.</span></div>
