<div>
<div><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>“They are all plain to him that</em></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>understandeth, and right to them</em></span></div>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>that find knowledge.”</em></span></div>

<div><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>GOD’S WORD MAKES ONE WISER</strong></span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Today, parents work hard and spend much on their children’s education,&nbsp;including tuition classes. Children, in response, strive hard to earn their&nbsp;degrees. They may learn more and know more than others who have not&nbsp;gone through such a rigorous system of studies. However, this does not&nbsp;mean they are wiser. A wise man is not measured by how much of the&nbsp;world’s knowledge he accumulates, but his knowledge of God and His&nbsp;will for him on this planet Earth.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Than mine enemies</span>: The psalmist knows his enemies are trying to boast of&nbsp;their wide knowledge and understanding. Yet, he is far wiser than them.&nbsp;His enemies are foolish for they say in their hearts that there is no God.&nbsp;So the psalmist knows for sure that he is far wiser than them because he&nbsp;believes in God who created the universe and this earth, including all&nbsp;things that are therein.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Than all my teachers</span>: His teachers may have introduced him to all the&nbsp;knowledge about the stars and moons, the animals and plants, and even&nbsp;the ethics and morality of life. Nevertheless, the psalmist is wiser than&nbsp;them for he knows who God is. Not only does he know God, he also has&nbsp;a personal relationship with Him! When he reads the Word of his God,&nbsp;he is well aware that those things he has studied will guide him in his life.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Than the ancients</span>: The ancients are the aged or the elderly. They have&nbsp;many experiences of life and they can say that they have eaten more&nbsp;salt than the young people have eaten rice. Although they have more&nbsp;experiences, they are nothing compared to the wisdom of a Christian&nbsp;who has the mind of Christ. Many ancients may argue against the record&nbsp;of God’s creation in the Book of Genesis, but we (who believe in it to the&nbsp;jot and tittle) know better.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Be wiser than the world! Keep your eyes on His Word, for through it,&nbsp;we are made wiser. And we can encourage and strengthen the saints to&nbsp;glorify God and to enjoy Him forever.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>THOUGHT:</strong> Am I wiser because of the Word of God?</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>PRAYER:</strong> Father, grant me the love to meditate upon Thy Word that I&nbsp;may be wiser in following and serving Thee.</span></div>
