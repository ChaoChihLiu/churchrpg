<div><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Zechariah 14:1-11</strong></span></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Jude 14-16</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>Sinners, seek His face now</em></span></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>or His wrath ye cannot bear later.</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>THE LORD COMETH WITH 10,000s OF HIS SAINTS</strong></span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Enoch, the seventh from Adam (Gen 5) walked with God in a world&nbsp;of rapidly declining morals, and God took him (Gen 5:24). What a&nbsp;wonderful testimony, and what a marvellous salvation that “<em>God took&nbsp;him</em>” to live in Heaven. To this saint of old, God gave a glimpse of the&nbsp;Second Coming. Enoch did not keep it to himself, but prophesied,&nbsp;meaning, declared: “<em>Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his&nbsp;saints, To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly…&nbsp;of all their ungodly deeds</em>…” (Jude 14-15).</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Coming of our Lord is the believer’s BLESSED HOPE (Titus 2:13).&nbsp;We, who are His redeemed, look with longing eyes and quickening pulse&nbsp;as the day draws near, when He will perfect our redemption. Paul, the&nbsp;Apostle, described this glorious prospect in Romans 8:18-23. In simpler&nbsp;words, he said, “Our present sufferings are bearable when we hold in view&nbsp;the glorious change awaiting us at the Lord’s return. Today, we groan,&nbsp;waiting for the redemption of our body from the bondage of corruption.&nbsp;On that great day, it will be worth it all!” The Apostle John said, “<em>We know&nbsp;that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him</em>” (1 John 3:2). We shall have&nbsp;joy unspeakable, full of glory!</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">For the unbelieving, the ungodly, the murmurers, complainers, walking&nbsp;after their own lusts, the Lord’s return spells judgment and swift sentence&nbsp;to everlasting destruction. Those who spurn Him as Saviour today will&nbsp;have to face Him as He will come “<em>in flaming fire taking vengeance on&nbsp;them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus&nbsp;Christ</em>” (2 Thess 1:8).</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Reader, be wise. Heed God’s Word. Tarry not. Confess your sins. Receive&nbsp;Christ into your heart as your Lord and Saviour. And be saved.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">His return as Judge is as sure as tomorrow’s sunrise.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>THOUGHT:</strong> The time to repent is NOW. “<em>How shall we escape, if we&nbsp;neglect so great salvation</em>…” (Heb 2:3)</span></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>PRAYER:</strong> Open my eyes, O Father, to the truth of Thy Word.</span></p>
