<div><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>GOD’S WORD AGAINST THE WICKED</strong></span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The wicked are condemned. They continue to reject Jesus as their Lord&nbsp;and Saviour. They hear the Gospel but they do not open their hearts to&nbsp;believe in the truth. They injure and destroy God’s followers. The wicked&nbsp;deserve the punishment of God and await the final judgment in the&nbsp;eternal lake of fire. They have no hope of entering God’s heaven.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">They are trodden down</span>: The wicked are tossed aside because they have&nbsp;erred from God’s Word. They are shaken off like unwanted rotten fruits&nbsp;because they are bad fruits. They are trodden down because they deceive&nbsp;with their lies. The Lord will surely take them out from among His people.&nbsp;They may be found living amid saints on earth, but they are to perish&nbsp;forever. They have no place in God’s Kingdom. They can never rise to be&nbsp;with the holy.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">They are put away like dross</span>: The wicked while here on earth are to be&nbsp;destroyed. They have no part in the holy congregation. They will not&nbsp;stand before the righteous judgment of God. They have no righteousness,&nbsp;and they are to be cast away. They are like refuse that must be removed.&nbsp;Their sins and transgression stink. They are to be burned so that the pure&nbsp;and genuine people of God will remain unstained by their errors. God’s&nbsp;children will be separated from them.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Word of God has complete instructions on how to discern the wise&nbsp;and the wicked. The Bible is the saint’s perfect guide in living a life safe&nbsp;from the evil influences of the wicked. The Word will show Christians the&nbsp;characters of the wicked that they can be identified. In response, believers&nbsp;have the responsibility to keep themselves away from the wicked. They&nbsp;must not walk with them, stand with them or sit with them. This means&nbsp;that believers must not agree with the wicked’s error, support them or&nbsp;plan wicked things with them.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Dear reader, tremble before the Lord and fear Him. Understand how God&nbsp;will condemn and punish the wicked. Be afraid of His judgments.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>THOUGHT:</strong> Do I have the wisdom to know who the wicked are?</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>PRAYER:</strong> Father, keep me away from the error of the wicked that I may&nbsp;be a useful vessel for Thy glory and honour.</span></div>
