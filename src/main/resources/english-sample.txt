<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">When Ruth went out to look for a place to glean, she committed herself to&nbsp;the leading of providence. But now as Naomi sought to get rest for her in&nbsp;the house of a husband, she took deliberate and calculated steps. A secure&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">and happy home cannot be achieved by chance. The Book of Proverbs is&nbsp;clear in that a good and godly wife is given by the LORD. In the Book of&nbsp;Psalms, the Psalmist categorically asserted, “<em>Except the LORD build the&nbsp;house, they labour in vain that build it: except the LORD keep the city, the&nbsp;watchman waketh but in vain</em>” (Ps 127:1).</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">“…<em>is not Boaz of our kindred</em>…” (Ruth 3:2)</span>. The process began with a&nbsp;reference to Boaz. This reference was important because it set the tone for&nbsp;the whole process. A Christian marriage requires those who enter into it&nbsp;do so in the Lord, and as such it must be as God’s Word doth allow. The&nbsp;mention of Boaz as a kindred would make the marriage lawful as God’s&nbsp;Word and the Law of Moses said that a widow “<em>shall not marry without&nbsp;unto a stranger</em>” (Deut 25:5). As such, the union that Naomi sought for&nbsp;Ruth would be one that was in accordance with God’s revealed will and&nbsp;thus a lawful one. In the New Testament, the apostle Paul pointed out a&nbsp;similar principle when he said, “<em>The wife is bound by the law as long as her&nbsp;husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married&nbsp;to whom she will; only in the Lord</em>” (1 Cor 7:39). Christian marriage must&nbsp;be strictly between Christians. Before beginning the process of pursuing&nbsp;a relationship that leads to marriage, the first things that must be&nbsp;ascertained (i.e. the prerequisites) are faith in Christ and the lawfulness&nbsp;of the union in accordance with God’s Word. In the marriage liturgy, the&nbsp;couple presenting themselves for holy matrimony are solemnly charged:&nbsp;“<em>For be ye well assured, that if any persons are joined together otherwise&nbsp;than as God’s Word doth allow, their marriage is not lawful</em>.” If a couple&nbsp;prays for and expects God’s blessings and help in their home, they must&nbsp;first submit themselves to God’s revealed will and ordinance.</span></div>
