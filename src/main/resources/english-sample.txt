<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">According to the Heidelberg Catechism on Providence, the answer given&nbsp;to Question 28 as regards the profit to man of the doctrine of providence&nbsp;states that: “That we may be patient in adversity; thankful in prosperity;&nbsp;and that in all things, which may hereafter befall us, we place our firm&nbsp;trust in our faithful God and Father, that nothing shall separate us from&nbsp;his love; since all creatures are so in his hand, that without his will they&nbsp;cannot so much as move.” The knowledge and understanding of the&nbsp;doctrine of the providence of God works to affirm, strengthen, and put&nbsp;our faith in God alone.</span></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">“<em>Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he shall bring it&nbsp;to pass</em>” (Ps 37:5)</span>. The perspective with which we view, assess and face&nbsp;life when shaped by the knowledge of God and His work of providence&nbsp;changes, especially with regard to the age-old difficulty that surrounds&nbsp;the issue of the prosperity of the wicked and the apparent triumph of&nbsp;evil. The three-fold call to trust given in Psalm 37:3-7 best summarises&nbsp;this change in view and perspective of life and its events. The providence&nbsp;of God requires a response from us, and that response is to be evidenced&nbsp;in our relationship with God despite the circumstances and goings-on&nbsp;around us. Our relationship to God and our approach to life is not to be&nbsp;governed by and based on the happenings of life or our understanding&nbsp;of the circumstances we find ourselves in. Rather, it is to be governed&nbsp;by our trust in God, and our knowledge of Him and His attributes,&nbsp;and His work. Psalm 37 encourages full trust and confidence in God,&nbsp;and this trust and confidence should keep us focused on our duty and&nbsp;submission to God, always doing that which we know to be good and&nbsp;acceptable to God. God has His way, His plan and will, and His time.&nbsp;Our response to this is presented by the Psalmist as to wait patiently for&nbsp;the LORD (Ps 37:7; 40:1). This waiting patiently also involves a prayerful&nbsp;consistency in times of adversity and affliction (Ps 3:4; 18:6; 55:17; 77:1;&nbsp;88:9; 116:1). Providence is the confidence that God is working according&nbsp;to His purpose and plan for us, and thus “<em>all things work together for good</em>”&nbsp;(Rom 8:28).</span></div>
