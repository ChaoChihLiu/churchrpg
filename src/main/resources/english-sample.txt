<div><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>JESUS THE LIGHT OF LIFE</strong></span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">There is always a truth or lesson behind a miracle performed by Jesus.&nbsp;Jesus is the One who opens our eyes to see the spiritual wonders of His&nbsp;Truth. How do we know for sure He has this power? Jesus proved it by His&nbsp;miracle. He healed a man who was born blind. Jesus opened his eyes, and&nbsp;he saw light for the first time. If Jesus could give sight to the physically&nbsp;blind, surely He could give light to the spiritually blind. To this blind&nbsp;man, Jesus not only gave sight, He also gave the light of life. When Jesus&nbsp;asked whether he believed on Him, the Son of God, he was quick to reply,&nbsp;“<em>I believe</em>,” and worshipped Him.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In contrast, the Pharisees were spiritually blind to Jesus. The blind man&nbsp;did not know the Law of Moses as well as those Pharisees, and yet could&nbsp;identify Jesus as a prophet. Perhaps, the similarity between his own&nbsp;healing to that of leprous Naaman, who was healed by Elisha when told&nbsp;to wash at the River Jordan (2 Kings 5:1-14), prompted him to think of&nbsp;Jesus as a prophet, who like Elisha was bestowed with divine power.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Another possibility is that he saw Jesus not just simply as any prophet,&nbsp;but the Moses-like Prophet of Deuteronomy 18:15, for the miracle He&nbsp;performed was truly unheard of; it was indeed stupendous. Read what the&nbsp;blind man said in John 9:32-33. Many of the miracles Moses performed in&nbsp;the time of the Exodus were never repeated in the history of Israel. Moses&nbsp;was a class above all the prophets of Israel that followed (Deut 34:10-12).&nbsp;Now the blind man encountered a man who had performed a healing&nbsp;that was as great as Moses’. Could He be the Moses-like Prophet that&nbsp;Moses himself prophesied would come? Later, when Jesus disclosed to&nbsp;him that He was the Son of God, he believed without hesitation. Moses&nbsp;was prophet-servant, but Jesus is the Prophet-Son, the Messianic Prophet&nbsp;who is greater than Moses. By so believing, the blind man proved to be&nbsp;a true disciple of Moses unlike the Pharisees who claimed to be Moses’&nbsp;disciples (John 9:28), and yet could not see that Jesus was the One of&nbsp;whom Moses had spoken. What blindness!</span></div>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>PRAYER:</strong> Father, may I never be blind to Thy truth.</span></p>
