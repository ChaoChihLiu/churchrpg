<div><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Leviticus 6</strong></span></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Matthew 5:38-42</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>“Speak unto the children of Israel,</em></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>and say unto them, If any man of you</em></span></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>bring an offering unto the LORD…”</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>MAKING RESTITUTION</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">From the sin of ignorance, God transits to the wilful sin. It is noted that&nbsp;the sin of ignorance was confined mainly to the sins committed against&nbsp;God. In Leviticus 6, wilful sins were deliberate transgressions against&nbsp;both man and God. This is stated clearly in Leviticus 6:2-3: “<em>If a soul sin,&nbsp;and commit a trespass against the LORD, and lie unto his neighbour in that&nbsp;which was delivered him to keep, or in fellowship, or in a thing taken away&nbsp;by violence, or hath deceived his neighbour; Or have found that which was&nbsp;lost, and lieth concerning it, and sweareth falsely; in any of all these that a&nbsp;man doeth, sinning therein</em>.” Based upon the Ten Commandments given&nbsp;to Israel, their relationship with one another was elevated to a divine level.&nbsp;When they sinned against man, it was also a sin against God. This means&nbsp;that their repentance must be at two levels.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Having brought their required offerings to the LORD, they had to also&nbsp;make restitutions to the person they sinned against. An apology without&nbsp;consequence would not suffice. Once caught, they had to return what was&nbsp;stolen and give an additional 20 percent (or one fifth) of what was taken.&nbsp;This penalty was just and fair. It would discourage stealing. The law was&nbsp;not meant to overly penalise the sinner. In today’s legal system, sometimes&nbsp;the prosecutor may ask the judge to overly punish the criminal to set an&nbsp;example so that others will not commit the same crime. This is foolish&nbsp;reasoning. If this reasoning is accepted, then cutting off hands for stealing&nbsp;will be the logical outcome. The sinful nature of man makes him a bond&nbsp;servant of sin whereby he cannot stop himself from sinning regardless&nbsp;of the punishment. Enforcing an extreme penalty will not prevent future&nbsp;crimes from being committed. Only believing in Christ will, for in Christ&nbsp;he is given a new heart. He will stop his criminal activities instantly. The&nbsp;judicial system is to mete out just justice, not extreme justice. This holds&nbsp;true in the church’s disciplinary standard as well. Every discipline must be&nbsp;for the purpose of restoration and be just and fair to God’s glory.</span></div>
