  God had not given Moses or Joshua direction on what to do in such a situation. It was expected of them to use their wisdom and the general guidelines in resolving the issues. For example, the daughters of Zelophehad had approached Moses regarding their inheritance. That was a new question and Moses had no reference point to help him decide. Thus, he asked God for an answer (

		<break time="200ms"/>). This was what Joshua should have done, for he was with Moses when the question of inheritance came up. However, he took the men of Gibeon as truthful. He did not investigate. The cunning approach of those men won.

  The men of Gibeon came because of the Name of the God of Israel. They said that they knew what God had done in Egypt and in the land of Moab beyond Jordan. This was what Rahab had told the spies also. All the inhabitants of Canaan knew what God had done for Israel and were fearful. These ambassadors of Gibeon told all these things to Joshua. Their solemn request from their elders was to seek a league of peace with Israel. However, they concealed their real identity. They said they came from a far country, although Gibeon was in the neighbourhood of Gilgal where Israel had camped.

  Joshua and the princes of Israel took them at their word, failing to ask counsel of God in their decision. The Gibeonites made themselves to look as if they had been travelling for several days to reach the camp of Israel. They said in Joshua chapter 9 verse 11 to 12,  " Wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake to us, saying, Take victuals with you for the journey, and go to meet them, and say unto them, We are your servants: therefore now make ye a league with us. This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it is dry, and it is mouldy. " They showed bottles of wine, garments and shoes to support their claim. They had taken time to devise how they would approach Israel.
